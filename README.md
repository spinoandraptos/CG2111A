# CG2111A
Source codes for NUS computing engineering module, CG2111A Engineering Principles and Practice II. My team managed to setup a system to control a mobile robot to navigate a complex maze with the use of a RPLIDAR-A1 360Â°Laser Range Scanner as our visualization tool. The robot is controlled by a Raspberry Pi microprocessor, which receives commands from an operator laptop over a secure TLS connection and relays these commands to an Arduino UNO to control the robot's movements. The Raspberry Pi also connects the RPLIDAR to a Robotic Operating System (ROS) network, allowing us to feed RPLIDAR readings into a remote laptop to generate a map of the maze using Hector SLAM algorithm.
